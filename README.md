# Commonality

Commonality helps you scale JavaScript monorepos and package ecosystems with the tools you already love.

No wrappers. No lock-in. Open-source.

[**Overview**](https://www.commonality.co/docs/overview) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[**Get started**](https://www.commonality.co/docs/getting-started)

## Features

Every feature in Commonality is designed to be adopted incrementally. Start with a single package and scale it to an entire organization.

[**Checks**](https://www.commonality.co/docs/checks)

Scale a consistently amazing developer experience with dynamic conformance checks that are run like tests and shared like lint rules.

[**Constraints**](https://www.commonality.co/docs/constraints)

Maintain a dependency graph that's easy to reason about by limiting which packages can depend on each other.

[**Tags**](https://www.commonality.co/docs/tags)

Group packages by their purpose, concern, or domain without a tight coupling to directory structure. Use tags to selectively apply checks and constraints to packages.

[**Codeowners**](https://www.commonality.co/docs/codeowners)

Correlate ownership rules from a `CODEOWNERS` file to packages in your project.

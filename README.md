# Commonality

Commonality helps you structure growing JavaScript monorepos and package ecosystems with the tools you already love.

No wrappers. No lock-in. Open-source.

[**Overview**](https://docs.commonality.co/overview) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[**Get started**](https://docs.commonality.co/quickstart)

Run the command below in an existing project to set up Commonality in seconds

```sh
npx commonality init
```

## Features

Every feature in Commonality is designed to be adopted incrementally. Start with a single package and scale it to an entire organization.

[**Checks**](https://docs.commonality.co/checks)

Scale a consistently amazing developer experience with a monorepo linter that can be customized to your standards and existing tools.

[**Constraints**](https://docs.commonality.co/constraints)

Maintain a dependency graph that's easy to reason about by limiting which packages can depend on each other.

[**Tags**](https://docs.commonality.co/tags)

Group packages by their purpose, concern, or domain without a tight coupling to directory structure. Use tags to selectively apply checks and constraints to packages.

[**Codeowners**](https://docs.commonality.co/codeowners)

Correlate ownership rules from a `CODEOWNERS` file to packages in your project.

Checks help you scale a consistently amazing developer experience with dynamic conformance checks that are run like tests and shared like lint rules.

Platform teams can roll out checks that deliver a consistent developer experience for an entire organization.

Tooling authors can create checks that enforce best practices for the tools they create for their entire user base.

## Configuring checks
Checks are defined your [project configuration file](/reference/project-configuration) at the root of your project.
You can use [selectors](/selectors) to run checks against all the packages in your project or a subset of packages.

<Tip>
  Leverage the [utility checks](/examples/recommended-checks#utility) from our [commonality-checks-recommended](/examples/recommended-checks) package to quickly get up and running for simple use cases.
</Tip>

```typescript commonality.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'commonality';
import * as recommended from 'commonality-checks-recommended';

export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    'buildable': [
      recommended.hasFile('package.json', {
        build: 'tsc --build',
        dev: 'tsc --watch',
      }),
    ],
  },
});
```

## Validating checks
You can view the status of your checks by running the [check command](/reference/cli#check).

```bash
commonality check
```

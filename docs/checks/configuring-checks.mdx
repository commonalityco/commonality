Checks are defined your [project configuration file](/reference/project-configuration).
You can use [selectors](/selectors) to run checks against all the packages in your project or a subset of packages.

Checks as paths to [check objects](/reference/check-object) that can be defined locally in your project or as exports from a package.

<Info>
  Paths must resolve to a file that has a [check
  object](/reference/check-object) as it's `default export`
</Info>

### Checks local to your project

You can configure paths to files relative to the `.commonality/config.json` file.

<Tip>
You can omit the `./` prefix when configuring checks local to your project.
</Tip>
```json .commonality/config.json
{
  "$schema": "https://commonality.co/config.json",
  "checks": {
    "buildable": [
      // Resolves to: .commonality/has-vite-config.{js,ts}
      "has-vite-config",

      // Resolves to: .commonality/scripts/has-build-scripts.{js,ts}
      "./scripts/has-build-scripts"
    ]

}
}

````

### Checks exported from a package
You can configure paths that resolve to files exported from a package. We use [import-meta-resolve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/import-meta-resolve) to resolve import paths.

<Tip>
Packages prefixed with `commonality-checks-` can omit the prefix as a shorthand when configuring checks.
</Tip>

```json .commonality/config.json
{
  "$schema": "https://commonality.co/config.json",
  "checks": {
    "buildable": [
      // Package named: @scope/my-team
      "@scope/my-team/has-internal-config",

      // Package named: commonality-checks-recommended
      "commonality-checks-recommended/sorted-dependencies",

      // Package named: commonality-checks-recommended
      "recommended/sorted-dependencies"
    ]
  }
}
````

## Validating checks

You can view the status of your checks by running the [check command](/reference/cli#check).

```bash
commonality check
```

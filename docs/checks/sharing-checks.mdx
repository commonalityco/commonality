Checks are best shared using packages.

<Tip>
We recommend prefixing packages intended for open source or community use with `commonality-checks`. This will allow for a shorter path when configuring them in your project configuration.

## Static checks
Checks that don't require any configuration can be added to your project by adding the them to directly to your project configuration file.

```ts sorted-dependencies.js
export default {
  name: 'sorted-dependencies',
  message: 'Dependencies must be sorted',
  validate: () => {
    // ...validation logic
  }
}
```


We recommend exporting static checks as separate entry points in your package.json.

```json package.json
{
  "name": "commonality-checks-myname",
  "exports": {
    "./has-code": "./has-code.js"
  }
}
```


Checks can then be configured using the full package name or shorthand if prefixed with `commonality-checks`.

```json .commonality/config.json
{
  "checks": {
    "*": [
      "commonality-checks-myname/sorted-dependencies",
      "myname/sorted-dependencies"
    ]
  }
}
```




## Composed checks
Checks that are designed to be configured by the user can be exported as functions.
```js has-script.js
export const hasScript = (name, value) => ({
  name: 'has-script',
  message: `package.json must have script "${name}" with value "${value}"`,
  validate: () => {
    // ...validation logic
  }
});
```

These checks can be exported from as named exports from a single file.

```js index.js
export * from './has-script.js'
```

Composed checks can then be exported from package's `main` entry point.

```json package.json
{
  "name": "commonality-checks-myname",
  "main": "index.js",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./index.js"
  }
}
```

Developers can then configure these checks and export them as static checks locally in their projects or as packages to standardize a toolchain across an organization.

```ts .commonality/has-build-script.ts
import { hasScript }

export default {
  name: 'has-build-script',
  message: 'Package must have standard build script',
  validate
}
```

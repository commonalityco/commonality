Commonality is designed to be incrementally adoptable and work alongside your existing workflows.

This guide will get you set up in a few seconds and show you how to leverage Commonality to structure your existing JavaScript projects.

<Steps>

<Step title="Install Commonality">

Running the `init` command will quickly get you up and running in any existing JavaScript project.

This command will:

1. Install `commonality` at the root of your project
2. Install and configure checks that benefit most multi-package projects from [commonality-checks-recommended](/examples/recommended-checks) (optional)

```bash
npx commonality@latest init
```

</Step>
<Step title="Run your first checks">

Checks ensure that packages in your project conform to a set of rules.

Try running the command below to view the status of the checks we've set up for you.

```bash
npx commonality check
```

</Frame>


You'll see the status of the checks run against all packages in your project.

Checks are also auto-fixable with a single keypress, making it easy to adhere to the best practices your team has created.



</Step>

<Step title="Tag your packages in Commonality Studio">

We've applied these checks to all packages using the `*` [selector](/selectors) in your [project configuration](/reference/project-configuration) but you can selectively apply checks to any subset of packages within your repo using [tags](/tags).

Commonality Studio is the best way to create and edit tags for packages within your project.

Open it in any JavaScript project by running the command below:

```bash
npx commonality studio
```

You can edit a package's tags either by selecting a package in the dependency graph under the "Constraints" view, or by clicking on a package's dropdown button in the "Checks" view.

<Note>
  Editing tags in Commonality Studio will update or create a
  [commonality.json](/reference/package-configuration) in package
  directories automatically. This saves you from manually managing many
  configuration files across your monorepo.

With tag [selectors](/selectors) you can enforce different conventions for different types of packages. For example:

- Check that packages with the tag `buildable` have a `build` and `dev` script.
- Check that packages with the tag `ui` have a `tsconfig.json` that is configured to handle JSX.
- Check that packages with the tag `nextjs` have a `next.config.js` that matches a standard config.

</Step>


<Step title="Set up dependency constraints">

[Selectors](/selectors) can also be used to apply constraints.
[Constraints](/constraints) prevent packages from depending on each other in ways that don't make sense but are allowed by your package manager. For example:

- No package should ever depend on an `application`
- `data` packages shouldn't depend on `ui` packages
- `config` packages should only depend on other `config` packages.

[Constraints](/constraints) are defined in your project configuration file and can be used to `allow` and `disallow` packages matching a [selector](/selectors).

```typescript commonality.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'commonality';
import * as recommended from 'commonality-checks-recommended';

export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    // ...
  },
  constraints: {
    '*': {
      disallow: ['deployable'],
    },
    data: {
      disallow: ['ui'],
    },
    config: {
      allow: ['config'],
    },
  },
});
```

[Constraints](/constraints) can also be used to create otherwise impossible workflows like:

- Simulating the functionality of private packages within the same monorepo with explicit `shared` tags.
- Ensuring that applications tagged `high-stability` cannot depend on packages tagged `experimental`.

[Constraints](/constraints) help you maintain a dependency graph that is easy to reason about at scale.

You can check ensure that your constraints are valid by running the command below.

```bash
commonality constrain
```

</Step>

  <Step title="Next steps">
    Now that you've learned the basics of checks and constraints you can further customize Commonality to your own workflows
    by creating custom checks or integrate Commonality into your CI pipeline to prevent regressions.

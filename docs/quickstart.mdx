Commonality is designed to be incrementally adoptable and work alongside your existing workflows.

This guide will get you set up in a few seconds and show you how to leverage Commonality to structure your existing JavaScript projects.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Commonality">

  Running the `init` command will quickly get you up and running in any existing JavaScript project.

  This command will:

  1. Install `commonality` at the root of your project
  2. Install and configure checks that benefit most multi-package projects from [commonality-checks-recommended](/examples/recommended-checks) (optional)

  ```bash
  npx commonality@latest init
  ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your first checks">

  Checks ensure that packages in your project conform to a set of rules.

  Try running the command below to view the status of the checks we've set up for you.

  ```bash
  npx commonality check
  ```

  <Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks.gif" />
  </Frame>

  You'll see the status of the checks run against all packages in your project.

  Checks are also auto-fixable with a single keypress, making it easy to adhere to the best practices your team has created.

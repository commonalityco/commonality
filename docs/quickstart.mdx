Commonality is designed to be incrementally adoptable and work alongside your existing workflows.

This guide will get you set up in a few seconds and show you how to leverage Commonality to structure your existing JavaScript projects.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Commonality">
Running the `init` command will quickly get you up and running in any existing JavaScript project.

This command will:

1. Install `commonality` at the root of your project
2. Install and configure checks that benefit most multi-package projects from [commonality-checks-recommended](https://github.com/commonalityco/commonality/tree/main/packages/commonality-checks-recommended) (optional)

```bash
npx commonality@latest init
```

</Step>

<Step title="Run your first checks">
Checks ensure that packages in your project conform to a set of rules.

Try running the command below to view the status of the checks we've set up for you.

```bash
npx commonality check
```

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks.gif" />
</Frame>

You'll see the status of the checks run against all packages in your project.

Checks are also auto-fixable with a single keypress, making it easy to adhere to the best practices your team has created.

</Step>

<Step title="Open Commonality Studio">
You can view your project's dependency graph, edit tags for packages, and more in Commonality Studio.

Run Commonality Studio with the following command:

```bash
npx commonality studio
```

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/studio-dark.png" />
</Frame>

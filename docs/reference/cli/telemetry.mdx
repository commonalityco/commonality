We collect anonymous error reports in order to fix bugs faster and improve Commonality for all developers.
This is completely optional and there are several ways to opt-out.

## What we collect

We do not collect any information pertaining to your project's code, or any personal information.

We only collect the following:

- Errors and unhandled promise rejections.
- The version of `commonality`installed
- The version of `node` being used
- How many times each CLI command is run and how long it takes to complete

title: check
---

Run configured checks against the current project. If there are invalid checks that are [fixable](/checks/creating-checks#auto-fixable-checks),
a prompt will appear asking if you would like to automatically fix them. This prompt will not appear if `process.env.CI` is set to `true` or if Commonality
detects a CI provider. Process will exit with a status code of `1` if any checks are invalid.

```bash copy
commonality check
```

#### Options

##### `--verbose`

Show the status of all checks regardless of status. By default, only invalid checks will be shown. Default is `false`.

```bash copy
commonality check --verbose
```

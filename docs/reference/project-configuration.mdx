A project configuration file is a `config.json` file located in the `.commonality` folder at the root of your project.

```json .commonality/config.json
{
  "$schema": "https://commonality.co/config.json",
  "checks": {
    "*": ["has-readme"],
    "publishable": ["ensure-license"]
  },
  "constraints": {
    "*": { "disallow": ["deployable"] },
    "config": { "allow": ["config"] }
  }
}
```

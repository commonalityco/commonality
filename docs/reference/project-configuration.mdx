A project configuration file is a `config.json` file located in the `.commonality` folder at the root of your project.

```json .commonality/config.json
{
  "checks": {
    "*": ["has-readme"],
    "publishable": ["ensure-license"]
  },
  "constraints": {
    "*": { "disallow": ["deployable"] },
    "config": { "allow": ["config"] }
  }
}
```

## Properties

An object whose keys are [selectors](/selectors) and whose values are paths to [check objects](/reference/check-object).

<Info>Checks will run in the order they are defined.</Info>

```json .commonality/config.json
{
  "checks": {
    "*": [
      // Path to a check local to the project
      "has-readme",
      "./has-readme",
      "./linting/eslint-extends-node",

      // Path to a custom check exported from a package
      "@scope/my-team/my-custom-check",
      "commonality-checks-recommended/sorted-dependencies"

      // Packages prefixed with "commonality-checks-" can use a shorthand

### `workspaces`

An array of [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#usage) patterns used to identify which directories should be included when searching for packages.

```ts commonality.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'commonality';

export default defineConfig({
  workspaces: ['apps/*', 'packages/**', '!**/dist/**'],
});
```

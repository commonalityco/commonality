## Install globally

A global installation of Commonality will automatically detect the structure of your project based on the directory that the command is run in.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install commonality --global
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn global add commonality
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm install commonality --global
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After installation, navigate to any JavaScript project and start Commonality Studio.

```bash
commonality studio
```

## Install in your project

If you're collaborating with others on the same project or if you're planning on running Commonality in CI you may want to add `commonality` as a dev dependency at the root of your project.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install commonality --save-dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add commonality --dev --ignore-workspace-root-check
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add commonality --save-dev --ignore-workspace-root-check
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Your global installation of Commonality will continue to work in other projects.
However, if Commonality is installed locally in a project, the local installation will always take precedence over the global one.

```ts
(source: unknown, target: unknown) => string
```

The `diff` utility makes it easier to provide a helpful [suggestion]() for check [messages](#message).

We use the `jest-diff` utility to generate a diff that highlights values present in `target` but not `source`.

Values will be stringified and parsed as lines of text. Lines that appear in `target` but not `source` will appear in red with a `+` prefix.

**Parameters**

<ResponseField name="source" type="unknown" required>
  Any value, representing the source of the diff.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="target" type="unknown" required>
  Any value, representing the target of the diff.
</ResponseField>

Returns a string representing the diff between `source` and `target`.

**Example**

```ts
diff('first', 'second');
//   first
// + second

diff(
  { name: 'my-package', version: '1.0.0' },
  { name: 'my-package', version: '2.0.0' },
);
//   Object {
//     "name": "my-package",
//     "version": "1.0.0",
// +   "version": "2.0.0",
//   }
```

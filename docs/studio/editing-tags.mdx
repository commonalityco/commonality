Commonality Studio is the easiest way to manage [tags](/tags) for your packages.

You can edit a package's tags either by selecting a package in the dependency graph under the "Constraints" view, or by clicking on a package's dropdown button in the "Checks" view.

Editing tags in Commonality Studio will update or create a [commonality.json](/reference/package-configuration)
in package directories automatically. This saves you from manually managing many configuration files across your monorepo.

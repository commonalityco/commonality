Limit packages to a specific business vertical and explicitly tag packages as `shared` to allow their use across teams.

```json .commonality/config.json
{
  "constraints": {
    "*": {
      "allow": ["shared"],
    },
    "commerce": {
      "allow": ["commerce"],
    },
    "marketing": {
      "allow": ["marketing"],
    },
  },
}
```

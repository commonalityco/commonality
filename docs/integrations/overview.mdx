Commonality is designed to easily integrate with your existing tools and workflows.
[Checks](/checks) can be customized to fit your project's needs or can be used to encourage best practices and standards.

<Note>
  Since there are so many ways to customize Commonality, we need your help! [Let
  us know here](https://github.com/commonalityco/commonality/discussions/308)
  which tools you'd like us to create examples for and we'll add them here.

Commonality will automatically detect a `CODEOWNERS` file and correlate ownership rules to packages in your project.
Codeowners will be visible within [Commonality Studio](/studio/introduction).

Packages may be at any of the locations below:

- `CODEOWNERS`
- `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- `.gitlab/CODEOWNERS`
- `docs/CODEOWNERS`

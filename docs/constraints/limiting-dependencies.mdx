Constraints help you maintain a dependency graph that's easy to reason about by limiting which packages can depend on each other.

Constraints are applied to dependencies where there both the source and target package are in the same workspace.
This means that constraints cannot be applied to external dependencies.

A constraint can `allow` and `disallow` packages using [selectors](/selectors), however if a dependency matches a `disallow` selector the constraint will fail even if it is allowed by an `allow` filter.

## `allow` vs `disallow`

Commonality provides two different ways to enforce constraints, each with varying degrees of strictness.

### `disallow` matches direct and transitive dependencies
`disallow` constraints will evaluate the entire upstream dependency graph for a package.
If any direct or transitive dependency matches a [selector](/selectors) within the `disallow` array, then the constraint will fail.

The following constraint...
```ts commonality.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'commonality';

export default defineConfig({
  constraints: {
    'high-availability': {
      disallow: ['beta'],
    },
  },
});
```

...will fail for the following dependency graph.

This is due to the fact that a transient dependency contains the matching `beta` tag.

A constraint with the `disallow` property will evaluate the entire upstream dependency graph for a package.
If any direct or transitive dependency matches a tag filter within the `disallow` array, then the constraint will fail.

`disallow` constraints should be used when a subset of packages should never have a dependency on another package.

### `allow` only matches direct dependencies

`allow` constraints will only evaluate direct dependencies for a package, transitive dependencies will never be evaluated.

These constraints are most helpful when constructing a hierarchy of packages within your project.

Constraints help you maintain a dependency graph that's easy to reason about by limiting which packages can depend on each other.

Constraints are applied to dependencies where there both the source and target package are in the same workspace.
This means that constraints cannot be applied to external dependencies.

Constraints are defined as a [constraint object](/sdk/constraint-object) in your [project configuration file](/sdk/project-configuration).

## `allow` constraints
```ts
"*" | string[]
```

`allow` constraints are used to explicitly define which dependencies a package is allowed to have.

<Info>
`allow` constraints only apply to direct dependencies.
</Info>


### Allow specific direct dependencies

This constraint will only allow direct dependencies that have the `api` or `internal` tag in it's [package configuration](/sdk/package-configuration).

These constraints are most helpful when constructing a hierarchy of packages within your project.

```json
{
  "disallow": ["api", "internal"]
}
```

### Allow all dependencies

This constraint will allow all direct dependencies.
This is equivalent to not having a constraint at all but is useful when you want to have the constraint show up in Commonality Studio or the CLI.

```json
{
  "disallow": "*"
}
```

## `disallow` constraints
```ts
"*" | string[]
```
`disallow` constraints will evaluate the entire upstream dependency graph for a package.
If any direct or transitive dependency matches a [selector](/selectors) within the `disallow` array, then the constraint will fail.

These constraints are most helpful when you know ahead of time that a package should never have a dependency on a category of packages.

<Info>
`disallow` constraints apply to all direct and transitive dependencies.
</Info>

### Disallow specific direct or transitive dependencies
This constraint will disallow any upstream dependency that has the `application` tag in it's [package configuration](/sdk/package-configuration).


```json
{
  "disallow": ["application"]
}
```

### Disllow all dependencies
This constraint will disallow all dependencies.

```json
{
  "disallow": "*"
}
```


### Example
The following constraint...
```ts commonality.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'commonality';

export default defineConfig({
  constraints: {
    'high-availability': {
      disallow: ['beta'],
    },
  },
});
```

...will fail for the following dependency graph.

This is due to the fact that a transitive dependency contains the matching `beta` tag.

## Precedence

A [constraint object](/sdk/constraint-object) can contain both `allow` and `disallow` constraints.
When both are present, `disallow` constraints will be evaluated first.

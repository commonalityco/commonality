## Create private local packages

Limit packages to a specific business vertical and explicitly tag packages as `shared` to allow their use across teams.

```ts filename="commonality.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'commonality';

export default defineConfig({
  constraints: {
    '*': {
      allow: ['shared'],
    },
    commerce: {
      allow: ['commerce'],
    },
    marketing: {
      allow: ['marketing'],
    },
  },
});
```

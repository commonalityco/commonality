Constraints prevent packages from depending on each other in ways that don't make sense but are allowed by your package manager.

They help you maintain a dependency graph thatâ€™s easy to reason about no matter how many packages are in your project.

You might want to use constraints to:

- Ensure no package can ever depend on an `application`
- Ensure `data` packages can't depend on `ui` packages
- Ensure `config` packages can only depend on other `config` packages.

## Configuring constraints

Constraints are defined as a [constraint object](/reference/constraint-object) in your [project configuration](/reference/project-configuration) file and can be used to `allow` and `disallow` packages matching a [selector](/selectors).

Here's an example of a configuration that enforces the constraints above:
```typescript commonality.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'commonality';
import * as recommended from 'commonality-checks-recommended';

export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    // ...
  },
  constraints: {
    '*': {
      disallow: ['deployable'],
    },
    data: {
      disallow: ['ui'],
    },
    config: {
      allow: ['config'],
    },
  },
});
```

## Validating constraints
You can view the status of your constraints by running the [constraint command](/reference/cli#constrain).


```bash
commonality constrain
```

## Precedence

A [constraint object](/reference/constraint-object) can contain both `allow` and `disallow` constraints.
When both are present, `disallow` constraints will be evaluated first.

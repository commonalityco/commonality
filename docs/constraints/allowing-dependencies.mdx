`allow` constraints will evaluate **direct dependencies** for a package.

If any local dependency does not have [tags](/tags) that match a [selector](/selectors) within the `allow` array, then the constraint will fail.

`allow` constraints are used to explicitly define which dependencies a package should have. They are helpful for defining a [hierarchy of packages](/integrations/dependency-hierarchy) or [creating workflows](/integrations/domain-boundaries).

<Info>
  Unlike `disallow` constraints, `allow` constraints only apply to direct
  dependencies.
</Info>

## Allow specific direct dependencies

Use a tag as a selector to allow subsets of local dependencies.

```json
{
  "disallow": ["api", "internal"]
}
```

## Allow all dependencies

Use `*` as a [selector](/selectors) to allow all local dependencies.

<Info>
  This is equivalent to not having a constraint at all but is useful when you
  want to be explicit and have the constraint show up in Commonality Studio or
  the CLI.
</Info>

```json
{
  "disallow": "*"
}
```

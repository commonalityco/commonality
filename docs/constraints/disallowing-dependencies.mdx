`disallow` constraints will evaluate all **direct and transitive dependencies** for a package.

If any local dependency has [tags](/tags) that match a [selector](/selectors) within the `disallow` array, then the constraint will fail.

## Disallow specific direct or transitive dependencies
Use a [tag](/tags) as a [selector](/selectors) to disallow subsets of local dependencies.

```json
{
  "disallow": ["application"]
}
```

## Disllow all dependencies
Use `*` as a [selector](/selectors) to disallow all local dependencies.

```json
{
  "disallow": "*"
}
```


## Example
The following constraint...
```ts commonality.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'commonality';

export default defineConfig({
  constraints: {
    'high-availability': {
      disallow: ['beta'],
    },
  },
});
```

...will fail for the following dependency graph.

This is due to the fact that a transitive dependency contains the matching `beta` tag.

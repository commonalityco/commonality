Commonality makes it easy to utilize checks and workflows created by other teams and the open-source community.
Share your best practices with the broader community and make an even bigger impact.


## Sharing checks

Organizing checks into a package local to your project not only keeps your project configuration file tidy, but also makes them easily sharable.

We recommend exporting checks as named exports from your checks package. This encourages consumers to explicitly import the checks they want to apply to their project.

<Note>
If you intend on sharing checks package publicly, we recommend prefixing your package name with `commonality-checks-` to make it more discoverable.
</Note>

```ts packages/commonality-checks-myteam/src/index.ts
import { defineCheck } from 'commonality';

export const hasScript = defineCheck(() => {
	return {
		name: 'my-team/has-script'
		// ...check definition
	}
})
```

```ts commonality.config.ts
import * myTeam from 'commonality-checks-myteam';

export default {
  checks: {
	"buildable": [
		myTeam.hasScript('dev', 'tsc --watch'),
  	]
  }
};
```

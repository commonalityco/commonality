# How to adopt Commonality

Every feature in Commonality is opt-in and designed to be adopted incrementally but here's how we recommended getting started.

<Steps>
### Categorize your packages

Commonality helps you scale a consistent developer experience across your monorepo and organization.
To do this, it helps you codify best practices for groups of packages in your project.

Open Commonality Studio to see all the packages within your monorepo.

```bash copy
commonality studio
```

Next, try and find common groups of packages that have similar needs. Some examples are:

- **Tooling:** packages that require common boilerplate or configuration files for tooling.
  I.e. `buildable`, `deployable`, `testable`

- **Concern:** packages that have a common concern or purpose
  I.e. `ui`, `data`, `config`

- **Domain:** packages that have a common product vertical or feature
  I.e. `checkout`, `marketing`, `ai`

Finally, attach tags that match your categories to packages directly in Commonality Studio.

<Callout type="info">
  Editing tags in Commonality Studio will update or create a `commonality.json`
  in each package directories automatically. This saves you from manually
  managing many configuration files across your monorepo.
</Callout>

### Add constraints

Now let's leverage the tags we just created to add constraints to your dependency graph.

You may find that there are certain packages that should never depend on each other. For example:

- `config` packages shouldn't depend on `deployable` packages.

- `high-stability` packages shouldn't depend on `beta` packages

</Steps>

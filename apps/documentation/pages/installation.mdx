# Installation

Commonality is designed to be adopted incrementally and works with any existing JavaScript project.

## Install globally

A global installation of Commonality will automatically detect the structure of your project based on the directory that the command is run in.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -g commonality
```

Navigate to any JavaScript project and open Commonality Studio to get started.

```bash
commonality studio
```

## Install in your project

If you're collaborating with others on the same project or if you're planning on running Commonality in CI you may want to add `commonality` as a dev dependency at the root of your project.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -D commonality
```

Your global installation of Commonality will continue to work in other projects but your local installation will always take precedence.

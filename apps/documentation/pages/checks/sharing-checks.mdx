# Organizing checks

While you definitely can define checks directly within a project configuration file, we recommend using packages to organize your checks.
This has the added benefit of making your checks ready to share with teams external to your project when you're ready to publish.

## Exporting checks

We recommend exporting checks as named exports from your checks package.
This encourages consumers to explicitly import the checks they want to apply to their project.
If you want to apply checks from multiple checks packages you can namespace your import to make it clearer.

```ts filename="packages/platform-checks/src/index.ts"
import { defineCheck } from 'commonality/checks';

export ensureESLintConfig = defineCheck(() => {
	return {
		// ...check definition
	}
})
```

```ts filename="commonality.config.ts"
import * platform from '@scope/commonality-checks-platform';

export default {
  checks: [],
};
```

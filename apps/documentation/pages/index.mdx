# Introduction

> Commonality helps you scale large JavaScript projects with the tools you already love.

We believe that modern monorepo tooling unlocks next generation workflows that help you deliver faster at bigger a scale.

But working with large monorepos is hard, and almost everyone has a horror story about working in one.

We want to change that.

## What is Commonality?

Commonality gives you a few new tools to help you tame the chaos of working in monorepos.

### CLI

Commonality works out-of-the-box with any JavaScript project and any package manager.

#### Checks

Every package is a possible point of fragmentation and it can start to feel like playing whack-a-mole to maintain a consistent developer experience.

Commonality helps you scale best practices with dynamic conformance checks that are run like tests and shared like lint rules.

#### Constraints

Config packages shouldn't depend on UI libraries.

UI libraries shouldn't depend on applications.

Commonality helps you maintain a dependency graph that doesn't look like spaghetti by limiting which packages can depend on each other.

### Studio

Sometimes you just need to visualize your monorepo to understand what's going on.

Commonality Studio is a local application that gives you a live view your dependency graph and the status of your conformance checks.

## What makes us different?

### Zero lock-in

Choose whatever tools work best for you and we'll help you get the most out of them. Commonality helps you scale your existing workflows, not replace them.

Rather than wrapping your tools to get a standardized experience, we'll guarantee your existing tools work exactly how you expect them to for every package in your monorepo.

### Strongly opinionated about anything

We make no assumptions about how your monorepo should be structured, the best practices that should be enforced, or the tools you should use.

Instead, we make it easy to create your own best practices and help you scale them across your organization.

### Always iterative

Commonality is designed to be adopted incrementally. You can start using it with a single package and scale it to your entire organization.

You can selectively apply features to groups of packages that you define, allowing you to not only incrementally adopt Commonality, but apply migrations and enforce your own incrementally as well.

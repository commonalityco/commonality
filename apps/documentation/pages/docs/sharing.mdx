## Exporting checks

We recommend exporting checks as named exports from your checks package.
This encourages consumers to explicitly import the checks they want to apply to their project.
If you want to apply checks from multiple checks packages you can namespace your import to make it clearer.

```ts filename="packages/platform-checks/src/index.ts"
import { defineCheck } from 'commonality/checks';

export ensureESLintConfig = defineCheck(() => {
	return {
		// ...check definition
	}
})
```

```ts filename="commonality.config.ts"
import * platform from '@scope/commonality-checks-platform';

export default {
  checks: [],
};
```

# Organizing checks

While you can certainly define checks directly within a project configuration file, we recommend using packages to organize your checks.

This approach has the added benefit of preparing your checks for sharing with teams external to your project when you're ready to publish.

## Example

```ts filename="commonality.config.ts"
import * as myTeamChecks from 'commonality-my-team/checks';

export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    ui: myTeamChecks.ensureReactTsConfig(),
    node: myTeamChecks.ensureNodeTsConfig(),
  },
});
```

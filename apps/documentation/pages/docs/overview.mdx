# Introduction

> Commonality helps you scale large JavaScript projects with the tools you already love.

We believe that modern monorepo tooling unlocks next generation workflows and efficiencies that help you ship faster at bigger a scale.
But working with large monorepos can be difficult, and almost everyone has a horror story about working in one.

Commonality aims to change that.

## What is Commonality?

Commonality is an open-source tool that gives you a few new superpowers to help you tame the chaos of working in growing monorepos. Our CLI will work with

### Checks

Every package is a possible point of toolchain fragmentation and it can start to feel like playing whack-a-mole to maintain a consistent developer experience.
Checks allow you to standardize tooling for subsets of packages, without wrapping your tools or creating lock-in.

This means platform teams can scale a consistently amazing developer experience across teams, and tooling authors can share codified best practices with their users.

Checks help you scale best practices with dynamic conformance checks that are run like tests and shared like lint rules.

### Constraints

Config packages shouldn't depend on UI libraries.

UI libraries shouldn't depend on applications.

Constraints help you maintain a dependency graph that doesn't look like spaghetti by limiting which packages can depend on each other.

## What makes us different?

### Zero lock-in

Commonality helps you scale your existing workflows, not replace them. Choose whatever tools work best for you and we'll help you get the most out of them.

We will never wrap your tools or lock you in to ours. You'll be able to delete Commonality from your project at any point without ever affecting any of your existing tools.

### Strongly opinionated about anything

We make no assumptions about how your monorepo should be structured, which rules should be enforced, or the tools you should use.

Instead, we make it easy to create your own best practices and help you scale them across your project or organization.

### Opt-in by default

Every feature in Commonality is designed to be adopted incrementally. You can start using it with a single package and scale it to an entire organization.

You can selectively apply checks and constraints to groups of packages at your own pace. Adopt our rules or incrementally enforce your own best practices as you create them.

## What are your plans for the future?

We want to build tools to make it easier to work with monorepos at scale and we want those tools to be free and open source, period.

We also believe that monorepo architecture unlocks new forms of workflow automation and we want to build that future.

We plan on building a platform that will automate common workflows for scaling package ecosystems. That platform will
have distinct features built on a foundation of free open source tooling.

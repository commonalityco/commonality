# Introduction

> Commonality helps you scale large JavaScript projects with the tools you already love.

We believe that modern monorepo tooling unlocks next generation workflows and efficiencies that help you ship faster at bigger a scale.
But working with large monorepos can be difficult, and almost everyone has a horror story about working in one.

We want to change that.

## What is Commonality?

Commonality is an open-source tool that gives you a few new superpowers to help scale [multi-package workspaces](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-platform/glossary#multi-package-workspace) and large package ecosystems.



### Scale best practices with checks

Every package is a possible point of toolchain fragmentation and it can start to feel like playing whack-a-mole to maintain a consistent developer experience.
[Checks](/docs/checks) allow you to standardize tooling and codify best practices for subsets of packages, without wrapping your tools or creating lock-in. 

[Checks](/docs/checks) help you scale a consistently amazing developer experience with dynamic conformance checks that are run like tests and shared like lint rules.

### Wrangle dependencies with constraints
In workspaces that contain more than a handful of packages there are often unwritten rules for dependencies.

Config packages shouldn't depend on UI libraries.

UI libraries shouldn't depend on applications.

[Constraints](/docs/constraints) help you maintain a dependency graph that's easy to reason about by limiting which packages can depend on each other.

## What makes us different?

### Zero lock-in

Commonality helps you scale your existing workflows, not replace them. Choose whatever tools work best for you and we'll help you get the most out of them.

We will never wrap your tools or lock you in to ours. You'll be able to delete Commonality from your project at any point without ever affecting any of your existing tools.

### Strongly opinionated about anything

We make no assumptions about how your monorepo should be structured, which rules should be enforced, or the tools you should use.

Instead, we make it easy to create your own best practices and help you scale them across your project or organization. 
You'll always have full control over how strongly rules are enforced.

### Opt-in by default

Every feature in Commonality is designed to be adopted incrementally. You can start using it with a single package and scale it to an entire organization.

Selectively apply [checks](/docs/checks) and [constraints](/docs/constraints) to groups of packages at your own pace. Adopt our rules or incrementally enforce your own best practices as you create them.

## Why now?

There has been a wave of new tooling over the past few years that has made it drastically easier to create and manage many packages within a single repository.
Tools like `pnpm`, `turbo`, `lerna`, `plop`, and `nx` have been the catalyst for an explosion of growth in JavaScript monorepos.

However, every new package added to a project introduces additional overhead. 
Every `package.json` becomes a possible point of toolchain fragmentation, making it difficult to guarantee a consistent developer experience across a project. 
Dependency graphs can quickly become spaghetti, leading to a debugging nightmare. 

Instead of choosing between scale and ease-of-use, Commonality gives you tools that allow you to have both. 

## What are your plans for the future?

We believe that building composable software with package-based architecture is the future. 
We want to build tools to make it easier to work with multi-package monorepos at scale and we want those tools to be free and open source.

We also believe that there are new workflows that come with multi-package workspace architecture that make large teams more efficient. 
We plan on building a platform that will automate common workflows when working with package ecosystems. 
That future platform will have distinct features built on a foundation of community and free open source tooling.

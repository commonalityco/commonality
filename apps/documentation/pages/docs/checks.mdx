# Checks
Checks help you scale a consistently amazing developer experience with dynamic conformance checks that are run like tests and shared like lint rules.

Platform teams can roll out checks that deliver a consistent developer experience for an entire organization.

Tooling authors can create checks that enforce best practices for the tools they create for their entire user base.

**Powerful plug and play conformance**

Quickly create custom conformance rules that validate file existence, file contents, even relationships between different files in your project, all backed by an easy to use API.

**Enforce with confidence**

No one wants a tool that blocks their workflow with flaky failures.
We provide [testing utilities and guidance](/docs/checks/testing-checks) so you can guarantee that checks only fail when you expect them to.

**Sharable by default**

No resolution magic and no new conventions to learn. Checks are just JavaScript functions so you can share them as you would with any other package.

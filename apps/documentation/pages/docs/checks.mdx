# Checks
Checks help you scale a consistently amazing developer experience with dynamic conformance checks that are run like tests and shared like lint rules.

Platform teams can roll out checks that deliver a consistent developer experience for an entire organization.

Tooling authors can create checks that enforce best practices for the tools they create for their entire user base.

Checks are designed with the following principles in mind:

1. **Customization without complexity**

Quickly create custom checks that validate file existence, file contents, even relationships between different files in your project, with [easy-to-use utilities](http://localhost:3000/docs/api/checks#utilities) that read and write to disk.

2. **Enforce with confidence**

No one wants a tool that blocks their workflow with false negatives.
We provide [testing utilities](/docs/checks/testing-checks) so you can guarantee that checks only fail when you expect them to.

3. **Sharable by default**

No resolution magic and no new conventions to learn. Checks are just JavaScript functions so you can share them as you would with any other package.

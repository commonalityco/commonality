# Codeowners
Commonality will automatically detect a `CODEOWNERS` file and correlate ownership rules to packages in your project. 
An array of `codeowners` will be available within [`CheckContext`]() and visible within [Commonality Studio]().

Packages may be at any of the locations below:
* `CODEOWNERS`
* `.github/CODEOWNERS`
* `.gitlab/CODEOWNERS`
* `docs/CODEOWNERS`

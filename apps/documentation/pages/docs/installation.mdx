# Installation

Commonality works with any existing JavaScript project.

## Install globally

A global installation of Commonality will automatically detect the structure of your project based on the directory that the command is run in.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
  npm install commonality --global 
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
  yarn global add commonality 
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
  pnpm install commonality --global 
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Navigate to any JavaScript project and open Commonality Studio to get started.

```bash copy
commonality studio
```

## Install in your project

If you're collaborating with others on the same project or if you're planning on running Commonality in CI you may want to add `commonality` as a dev dependency at the root of your project.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
  npm install commonality --save-dev 
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn add commonality --dev --ignore-workspace-root-check 
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm add commonality --save-dev --ignore-workspace-root-check 
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Your global installation of Commonality will continue to work in other projects but your local installation will always take precedence.

# Installation

Commonality works with any existing JavaScript project.

**System Requirements:**

* [Node.js 18.17](https://nodejs.org) or later.

* macOS, Windows, and Linux are supported.

## Install globally

A global installation of Commonality will automatically detect the structure of your project based on the directory that the command is run in.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
  npm install commonality --global
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
  yarn global add commonality
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
  pnpm install commonality --global
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After installation, navigate to any JavaScript project and start Commonality Studio.

```bash copy
commonality studio
```

## Install in your project

If you're collaborating with others on the same project or if you're planning on running Commonality in CI you may want to add `commonality` as a dev dependency at the root of your project.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
  npm install commonality --save-dev
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn add commonality --dev --ignore-workspace-root-check
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm add commonality --save-dev --ignore-workspace-root-check
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Your global installation of Commonality will continue to work in other projects.
However, if Commonality is installed locally in a project, the local installation will always take precedence over the global one.

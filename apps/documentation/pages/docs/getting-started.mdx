# Getting Started

You can run `npx commonality studio` in any monorepo to get started without installing any dependencies.
However, Commonality is most useful when it becomes a part of your daily workflow.

All features are designed to be adopted incrementally.
Here's how we recommend getting up an running in a repostitory that has multiple collaborators.

<Steps>

### Install dependencies

If you're working on a project with others, you'll want to locally install `commonality` at the root of your project 
to get a consistent developer experience. We're also going to install the `commonality-recommended` package 
to set up some initial [checks](/docs/checks).

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
  npm install commonality commonality-recommended --save-dev 
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn add commonality commonality-recommended --dev --ignore-workspace-root-check 
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm add commonality commonality-recommended --save-dev --ignore-workspace-root-check 
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Set up checks

You'll be able to get value from Commonality right away by installing our `commonality-recommended`
package which includes common checks useful in any monorepo.

Create a `commonality.config.ts` or `commonality.config.js` at the root of your repository and apply
checks that you feel make the most sense for your project. Alternatively, you can [create your own
checks](/docs/checks/creating-checks) or use checks from other packages.

<Callout type="info">
  For documentation on all rules in the `commonality-recommended` package check
  out the README
</Callout>

```ts filename="commonality.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'commonality';
import * as recommended from 'commonality-recommended';

export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    '*': [
      recommended.devPeerDependencyRange(),
      recommended.ensureCodeowner(),
      recommended.ensureLicense(),
      recommended.ensureReadme(),
      recommended.multipleDependencyTypes(),
      recommended.noExternalMismatch(),
      recommended.repositoryField(),
      recommended.sortedDependencies(),
      recommended.validPackageName(),
    ],
  },
});
```

Let's try running these checks against your project with:
```bash copy
commonality check
```

### Categorize your packages

Commonality helps you scale a consistent developer experience across your monorepo and organization.
[Tag filters](/docs/api/configuration#tag-filters) help you achieve this by helping you codify best 
practices for groups or categories of packages in your project. Let's define those categories now.

Open Commonality Studio to see all the packages within your monorepo.

```bash copy
commonality studio
```

Next, try and find common groups of packages that have similar needs. Some examples of categories are:

- **Tooling:** packages that require common boilerplate or configuration files for tooling.
  I.e. `buildable`, `deployable`, `testable`

- **Concern:** packages that have a common concern or purpose
  I.e. `ui`, `data`, `config`

- **Domain:** packages that have a common product vertical or feature
  I.e. `checkout`, `marketing`, `ai`

Attach tags that match categories found in your project to packages directly in Commonality Studio.

<Callout type="info">
  Editing tags in Commonality Studio will update or create a `commonality.json`
  in each package directories automatically. This saves you from manually
  managing many configuration files across your monorepo.
</Callout>

### Add constraints

Now let's leverage the tags we just created to add [constraints](/docs/constraints) to the dependency graph.

You may find that there are certain packages that should never depend on each other. For example:

- All packages should never depend on `deployable` packages.

- `ui` packages should only depend on `utility`, and `config` packages.

- `config` packages should only depend on other `config` packages.

Adding constraints allows you to codify these rules and prevent your dependency graph from becoming spaghetti.
This saves you from endless dependency debugging and increased mental overhead.

Let's add some of these rules to our project configuration file

```ts filename="commonality.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'commonality';
import * as recommended from 'commonality-recommended';

export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    // ...
  },
  constraints: {
    "*": {
      disallow: ["deployable"]
    },
    "ui": {
      allow: ["utility", "config"]
    },
    "config": {  
      "allow": ["config"]
    }
  }
});
```

Let's check the validity of the constraints we just created with:
```bash copy
commonality check
```

### Next steps
Now that you've learned the basics of checks and constraints you can further customize Commonality to your own workflows
by creating custom checks or integrate Commonality into your CI pipeline to prevent regressions.

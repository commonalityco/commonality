# Studio

Commonality Studio is the best way to visualize your monorepo. Explore your dependency graph, manage tags, and view conformance health.

Start Commonality studio with the following command:

```bash copy
commonality studio
```

Commonality Studio requires the `@commonalityco/studio` package.
If you run `commonality studio` you will be asked if you would like to install `@commonalityco/studio` if it is not already.

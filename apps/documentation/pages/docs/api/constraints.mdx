# Constraints

Constraints are used to limit which packages can depend on one another.

## Properties

### `disallow`

<Subtext>
`"*" | string[]{:ts}`
</Subtext>

Disallow constraints are applied to all direct and transitive dependencies.

#### Disallow all direct and transitive dependencies

Commonality will disallow any direct or indirect dependency

```json
{
  "disallow": "*"
}
```

#### Allow specific direct and transitive dependencies

Commonality will only allow direct dependencies that have the `api` or `internal` tag in it's [package configuration](/reference/configuration#package-configuration).

```json
{
  "disallow": ["api", "internal"]
}
```

### `allow`

<Subtext>
`"*" | string[]{:ts}`
</Subtext>

Constraints may allow all direct dependencies or a list of tags that all direct dependencies must have.

#### Allow all direct dependencies

Commonality will allow all direct dependencies

```json
{
  "allow": "*"
}
```

#### Allow specific direct dependencies

Commonality will only allow direct dependencies that have the `api` or `internal` tag in it's [package configuration](/reference/configuration#package-configuration).

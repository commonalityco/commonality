# CLI

## Option Syntax

Options that accept a value can be passed with or without an equals sign.

```bash
--option=value
--option="value"

--option value
--option "value"
```

Options that accept a boolean value be `true` if no value is passed.
Options can explicitly be set to `false` by passed it as a value.

```bash
# Set as true
--option
--option=true

# Set as false
--option=false
```

## Global Options

These options can be used with any command.

### `--color`

Force color in output when running Commonality CLI commands.
You can also use the `FORCE_COLOR` environment variable to control which colors should be output.
This flag hooks into [supports-color](https://github.com/chalk/supports-color) under the hood.

```bash copy
commonality check --color
```

```bash copy
declare -x FORCE_COLOR=1
commonality check --color
```

### `--no-color`

Suppress all color in output when running Commonality CLI commands.
This flag hooks into [supports-color](https://github.com/chalk/supports-color) under the hood.

```bash copy
commonality check --no-color
```

```bash copy
declare -x FORCE_COLOR=0
commonality check
```

## Commands
